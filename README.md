# OwOScript
The coding language used in our game codeventure, right now being developed by JixS4v with the occasional help of Mariothedog. This repo was separated from the regular codeventure branch for commodity and organization, but codeventure will be updated and bundled always with the last stable version

Check out codeventure at https://github.com/tri-c-games/codeventure and our discord server at https://discord.gg/axcSMdZ

# About the language
OwOscript is a mix between a dynamically typed and a statically typed language that aims to teach coding to young people. It requires you to use brackets and semicolons like a statically typed language but allows you to define variables like in a dynamically typed language.
